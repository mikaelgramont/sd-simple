	<dt>What is it?</dt>
	<dd>Surfing Dirt is a site about mountainboarding. As of 2017, it’s just an idea, but soon it will evolve into something fun and useful for mountainboarders. Stay tuned!</dd>

	<dt>But I know this name.</dt>
	<dd>That means you’ve been around mountainboarding for a long time! Surfing Dirt used to be a very active forum. It slowly died down like many forums and sites. But we’re bringing it back!</dd>

	<dt>When can I use it?</dt>
	<dd>It’s going to take a lot of work to build this, so we can’t promise much before Spring 2018.  Before that, we’ll post content and you can check out <a href="<?php echo BASE_URL ?>forum">the Surfing Dirt forum</a>, which still exists!</dd>

	<dt>Anything else?</dt>
	<dd>We encourage you to sign up for our newsletter. We promise we’ll only send you a few updates before we launch.</dd>

	<dt></dt>
	<dd>See you soon!</dd>
